# Blackjack
Assignment from the IronYard.  Provided a set of specs, build blackjack so that the specs are passing.

Learning objectives:

    * Classes to structure and organize logic and data
    * initialize and method definition to implement classes to a spec
    * require to split projects into multiple files
